Hey there! My name is Jeremy Nauta.

I am a big fan of music, tech and soccer. You'll often find me writing
code or dreaming of big ideas.


I love building beautiful things with software. I tend to prefer
Python, Go and Node.js, but I don't discriminate.

Letâ€™s talk! If you like what you read, leave a comment or [email][email] me.
